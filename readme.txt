== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the shortcodes to insert the islamic graphics? =
The basic shortcode structure is [shortcode_name h=""]

The following are a list of possible values for shortcode_name, and the islamic phrases that will result when they are used:
* alayhis	- 'alayhis salam
* ranha		- radiallahu anha
* ranhu		- radiallahu anhu
* ranhum 	- radiallahu anhum
* saw		- sallalahu 'alayhi wa salam
* swt		- subhanahu wa ta 'ala

The h attribute is optional and controls the image height in pixels; it defaults to 20.

E.g., the shortcode to insert the black "sallalahu 'alayhi wa salam" graphic with a default height of 20px is: [saw]

E.g., the shortcode to insert the black "'alayhis salam" graphic with a height of 25px is: [alayhis h="25"]

= How do I insert a white version of the graphic? =
Append "_w" to the shortcode_name.

E.g., the shortcode to insert the white "subhanahu wa ta 'ala" graphic: [swt_w]

= Can I customise the graphic via CSS? =
Yes. Images have the class reference 'islamic_graphic' to allow CSS customisation.

= Who designed the graphics? =
The SAW graphic is based on the unicode symbol: ï·º.
The other graphics were based on the font "Islamic Phrases", designed by AlMedia.net, which is available to download for free, for personal use only, from http://www.almedia.net/free-arabic-fonts.htm.
